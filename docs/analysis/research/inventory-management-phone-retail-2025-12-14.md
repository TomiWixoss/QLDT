## Inventory Management Fundamentals

### Tầm Quan Trọng của Inventory Management trong Phone Retail

**Why Inventory Management is Critical:**

**1. High-Value Products (90% importance)**

-   Điện thoại là high-value items ($200-$2,000 per unit)
-   Inventory value lớn → Cần quản lý chặt chẽ
-   Shrinkage 1% = mất hàng triệu đô la
-   Example: 1,000 phones @ $500 = $500,000 inventory value

**2. Fast-Moving Technology (85% importance)**

-   Smartphone models mới ra mắt liên tục (6-12 tháng)
-   Old models giảm giá nhanh (20-40% sau 6 tháng)
-   Dead stock = capital tied up + storage costs
-   Need to sell before depreciation

**3. Customer Expectations (80% importance)**

-   Customers muốn latest models available
-   Out-of-stock = lost sales + poor experience
-   Overstocking = cash flow issues
-   Balance là key

**4. Omnichannel Complexity (75% importance)**

-   Inventory phải sync giữa online và offline
-   BOPIS orders cần real-time stock visibility
-   Multi-location stock transfers
-   Unified inventory pool

**5. Regulatory Compliance (70% importance)**

-   IMEI tracking required by law (nhiều quốc gia)
-   Warranty management
-   Anti-theft measures (blacklist IMEI)
-   Tax compliance

### Key Inventory Metrics

**1. Inventory Turnover Ratio**

-   **Formula**: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value
-   **Benchmark**: 6-12 times/year cho phone retail
-   **Interpretation**: Higher = better (faster selling)
-   **Example**: $6M COGS / $1M avg inventory = 6x turnover

**2. Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)**

-   **Formula**: (Average Inventory / COGS) × 365
-   **Benchmark**: 30-60 days cho phone retail
-   **Interpretation**: Lower = better (faster selling)
-   **Example**: ($1M / $6M) × 365 = 61 days

**3. Stock-to-Sales Ratio**

-   **Formula**: Ending Inventory Value / Sales for Period
-   **Benchmark**: 1.5-2.5 cho phone retail
-   **Interpretation**: Optimal range balances availability và cash flow

**4. Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)**

-   **Formula**: Gross Margin / Average Inventory Cost
-   **Benchmark**: 3.0+ cho phone retail
-   **Interpretation**: Higher = better profitability per inventory dollar
-   **Example**: $2M gross margin / $1M avg inventory = 2.0 GMROI

**5. Shrinkage Rate**

-   **Formula**: (Recorded Inventory - Actual Inventory) / Recorded Inventory
-   **Benchmark**: < 1% cho phone retail (high-value items)
-   **Interpretation**: Lower = better (less theft/damage/errors)
-   **Example**: ($1M - $990K) / $1M = 1% shrinkage

**6. Stockout Rate**

-   **Formula**: Number of Stockouts / Total SKUs
-   **Benchmark**: < 5% cho phone retail
-   **Interpretation**: Lower = better availability

**7. Dead Stock Percentage**

-   **Formula**: Dead Stock Value / Total Inventory Value
-   **Benchmark**: < 5% cho phone retail
-   **Interpretation**: Lower = better (less obsolete inventory)

-   **Solution**: RFID tags, security cameras, IMEI blacklist

**Challenge 4: Warranty and Returns**

-   **Problem**: Defective units, customer returns
-   **Impact**: Inventory accuracy issues, refurbishment costs
-   **Solution**: Separate inventory categories (new, refurbished, defective)

**Challenge 5: Multi-Location Complexity**

-   **Problem**: Nhiều cửa hàng, stock levels khác nhau
-   **Impact**: Stockouts tại một location, overstocking tại location khác
-   **Solution**: Centralized inventory management, smart stock transfers

**Challenge 6: Omnichannel Inventory Sync**

-   **Problem**: Online và offline inventory không đồng bộ
-   **Impact**: Overselling, customer disappointment
-   **Solution**: Real-time inventory sync, unified inventory pool

## Multi-Location Inventory Management

### Centralized vs Decentralized Inventory

**Centralized Inventory Model:**

-   **Concept**: One central warehouse, stores order from warehouse
-   **Pros**:
    -   Lower total inventory (no duplication)
    -   Easier to manage
    -   Better bulk purchasing power
-   **Cons**:
    -   Longer lead times to stores
    -   Shipping costs
    -   Risk of stockouts if warehouse runs out

**Decentralized Inventory Model:**

-   **Concept**: Each store holds own inventory
-   **Pros**:
    -   Faster fulfillment (stock on-site)
    -   No shipping costs between warehouse and store
    -   Stores can respond to local demand
-   **Cons**:
    -   Higher total inventory (duplication)
    -   Risk of imbalanced stock levels
    -   Harder to manage

**Hybrid Model (Recommended for Phone Retail):**

-   **Concept**: Central warehouse + store inventory + smart transfers
-   **Pros**:
    -   Balance between speed và efficiency
    -   Flexibility to transfer stock between stores
    -   Optimize inventory levels
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Fast-moving items: Stock at all stores
    -   Slow-moving items: Stock at warehouse only
    -   Smart transfers: Move stock from overstocked to understocked stores

_Nguồn: Multi-location inventory best practices, Cin7, BeatRoute 2024_

### Stock Transfer Management

**When to Transfer Stock:**

-   Store A has excess inventory (slow sales)
-   Store B has stockout or low inventory (high demand)
-   New store opening (initial stock)
-   Seasonal demand shifts (e.g., beach stores in summer)

**Stock Transfer Workflow:**

```
1. Identify need (low stock alert at Store B)
2. Check availability at other locations
3. Create transfer order (Store A → Store B)
4. Pick items at Store A (scan IMEI)
5. Pack and ship
6. Receive at Store B (scan IMEI to verify)
7. Update inventory at both locations
8. Track transfer in-transit
```

**Best Practices:**

-   ✅ Use IMEI scanning để ensure accuracy
-   ✅ Track transfers in-transit (separate status)
-   ✅ Set transfer approval workflows (prevent unauthorized transfers)
-   ✅ Optimize transfer routes (minimize shipping costs)
-   ✅ Regular transfer reviews (identify patterns)

### Unified Inventory Pool

**Concept:**

-   All inventory across all locations is visible và available
-   Customers can buy from any location, fulfill from optimal location
-   Example: Customer orders online, system finds nearest store with stock, ships from there

**Benefits:**

-   **Higher Fill Rates**: Reduce stockouts by leveraging all locations
-   **Lower Total Inventory**: No need to duplicate stock at every location
-   **Better Customer Experience**: Faster fulfillment, more availability
-   **Optimized Shipping**: Ship from nearest location

**Implementation Requirements:**

-   Real-time inventory sync across all locations
-   Smart order routing (find optimal fulfillment location)
-   Store fulfillment capabilities (pick, pack, ship from store)
-   Inventory allocation rules (reserve stock for in-store vs online)

## Demand Forecasting and Optimization

### Demand Forecasting Methods

**1. Historical Sales Analysis**

-   **Method**: Analyze past sales data để predict future demand
-   **Data Needed**: Sales by SKU, by location, by time period
-   **Tools**: Excel, BI tools (Tableau, Power BI), inventory software
-   **Accuracy**: 70-80% for stable products

**2. Seasonal Trends**

-   **Method**: Identify seasonal patterns (e.g., back-to-school, holidays)
-   **Phone Retail Seasonality**:
    -   **Q4 (Oct-Dec)**: Highest sales (holidays, new iPhone launch)
    -   **Q1 (Jan-Mar)**: Post-holiday dip
    -   **Q2 (Apr-Jun)**: Moderate sales
    -   **Q3 (Jul-Sep)**: Back-to-school spike
-   **Adjustment**: Increase inventory before peak seasons

**3. Product Lifecycle Stage**

-   **Launch Phase**: High demand, limited supply → Allocate carefully
-   **Growth Phase**: Increasing demand → Ramp up inventory
-   **Maturity Phase**: Stable demand → Maintain optimal levels
-   **Decline Phase**: Decreasing demand → Reduce inventory, clearance sales

**4. Market Trends and Events**

-   **New Model Launches**: Spike in demand for new models, drop for old models
-   **Competitor Actions**: Price wars, promotions
-   **Economic Factors**: Recession → Lower demand for premium phones
-   **Technology Shifts**: 5G adoption, foldable phones

**5. AI/ML Forecasting**

-   **Method**: Machine learning algorithms analyze multiple factors
-   **Factors**: Historical sales, seasonality, trends, promotions, weather, events
-   **Tools**: Cin7 Omni, NetSuite, SAP
-   **Accuracy**: 85-95% with sufficient data

_Nguồn: Demand forecasting methods, Cin7, BeatRoute, Shopify 2024_

### Reorder Point Optimization

**Reorder Point Formula:**

```
Reorder Point = (Average Daily Sales × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

**Example:**

-   Average Daily Sales: 5 units
-   Lead Time: 7 days (time to receive from supplier)
-   Safety Stock: 10 units (buffer for demand spikes)
-   **Reorder Point**: (5 × 7) + 10 = 45 units

**When stock reaches 45 units → Place order**

**Safety Stock Calculation:**

```
Safety Stock = (Max Daily Sales - Avg Daily Sales) × Max Lead Time
```

**Example:**

-   Max Daily Sales: 10 units
-   Avg Daily Sales: 5 units
-   Max Lead Time: 10 days
-   **Safety Stock**: (10 - 5) × 10 = 50 units

**Dynamic Reorder Points:**

-   Adjust based on seasonality (higher before holidays)
-   Adjust based on promotions (higher during sales events)
-   Adjust based on product lifecycle (lower for declining models)
